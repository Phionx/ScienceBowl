Assume standard gravity to be 10 m/s^2.",Answer: 8000 m/s (also acceptable: 8 km/s). Exhaust velocity is the product of specific impulse as a unit of time and standard gravity.,"If an engine has a specific impulse of 500 seconds and a thrust of 10 kN, how long will it take the engine to burn 50 kg of fuel? Assume standard gravity to be 10 m/s^2.","Answer: 25 seconds. 
Since Fthrust = Gstandard×Isp×R, where
	Fthrust = instantaneous thrust of the engine (in newtons)
	Gstandard = standard gravity (usually 9.81 m/s^2, but for simplicity we round to 10)
	Isp = specific impulse of the engine in seconds
	R = mass flow rate in kg/s
10000 = 10×500×R, so R = 2 kg/s
